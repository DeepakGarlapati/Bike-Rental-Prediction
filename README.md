# Bike Rental Prediction
Bike sharing has been gaining popularity all over the world. People can rent bike from one location and return at other. Thus such data can be captured to understand the mobility of bikes in the city and construct a business model out of it.

We build regression models to predict bike counts based on weather and environmental settings so that inventory can be managed efficiently.
